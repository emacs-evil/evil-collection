;;; Commentary:
;; Evil bindings for `ag-mode' from the `wgrep-ag' package.

;;; Code:
(require 'ag nil t)
(require 'evil)

(defun evil-ag-setup ()
  (evil-add-hjkl-bindings ag-mode-map 'normal
    "gg" #'evil-goto-first-line
    "gr" #'recompile
    "gj" #'compilation-next-error
    "gk" #'compilation-previous-error
    (kbd "C-j") #'compilation-next-error
    (kbd "C-k") #'compilation-previous-error
    "0" #'evil-digit-argument-or-evil-beginning-of-line
    "n" #'evil-search-next
    "N" #'evil-search-previous)

  ;; `ag' is best set in 'normal state because its buffer can be edited.
