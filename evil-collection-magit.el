;;; Commentary:
;;; Bindings for `magit'
;;; This file is to work around an issue described in
;;; https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection/issues/108
;;; Ideally this file is only temporary and should be removed once
;;; #108 is resolved.

;;; Code:
(require 'evil-collection)
(require 'magit nil t)

(defvar magit-blame-mode-map)

(defconst evil-collection-magit-maps '(magit-blame-mode-map))

;;;###autoload
(defun evil-collection-magit-setup ()
  "Set up `evil' bindings for `magit'."
  (evil-collection-define-key 'normal 'magit-blame-mode-map
    "q" 'magit-blame-quit))

(provide 'evil-collection-magit)
;;; evil-collection-magit.el ends here
