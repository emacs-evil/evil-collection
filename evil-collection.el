;; A set of keybindings for Evil mode.
;;
;; If you want to use Evil in the minibuffer, you'll have to enable it by
;; setting `evil-collection-setup-minibuffer' to t before loading this package.
;; This is so because many users find it confusing.
;; Some minibuffer-related packages such as Helm rely on this option.

STATES should be the name of an evil state, a list of states, or nil. KEYMAPS
should be a symbol corresponding to the keymap to make the translations in or a
list of keymap symbols. Like `evil-define-key', when a keymap does not exist,
the keybindings will be deferred until the keymap is defined, so
`with-eval-after-load' is not neccessary. TRANSLATIONS corresponds to a list of
key replacement pairs. For example, specifying \"a\" \"b\" will bind \"a\" to
\"b\"'s definition in the keymap. Specifying nil as a replacement will unbind a
key. If DESTRUCTIVE is nil, a backup of the keymap will be stored on the initial
invocation, and future invocations will always look up keys in the backup
keymap. When no TRANSLATIONS are given, this function will only create the
backup keymap without making any translations. On the other hand, if DESTRUCTIVE
is non-nil, the keymap will be destructively altered without creating a backup.
For example, calling this function multiple times with \"a\" \"b\" \"b\" \"a\"
would continue to swap and unswap the definitions of these keys. This means that
when DESTRUCTIVE is non-nil, all related swaps/cycles should be done in the same
invocation."
